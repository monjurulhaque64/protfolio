    aboutme: "My name is Monjurul Haque, and I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am 23 years old and currently studying a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Manarat International University. I am full stack web developer. I have learned a wide variety of Front-End technologies, Including HTML, CSS, Javascript and a few popular frameworks, such as Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React js, as well some Back-End technologies, such as Node js and MongoDB. I finished some Full-Stack projects, In addition to my technical skills, I have practical experience in Machine Learning. As an assistant to my teachers and seniors, I actively contributed to a sign language recognition system project. This opportunity allowed me to apply my technical expertise in a real-world context and develop a deep understanding of Machine Learning principles. Furthermore, my involvement in various robotics competitions during my university years, where I led the MIU-Analytica team, honed my leadership, problem-solving, and teamwork abilities. ",
